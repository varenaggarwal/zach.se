## Question

<p>
The cube, $41063625$ ($345^3$), can be permuted to produce two other cubes: $56623104$ ($384^3$) and $66430125$ ($405^3$). 
In fact, $41063625$ is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.
</p>

<p>
Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are cube.
</p>






## Haskell

```haskell
import Data.List (sort)
import qualified Data.Map as Map

cubes :: Map.Map String [Integer]
cubes = Map.fromListWith (++) [(sort (show cube), [cube]) | x <- [1..10000], let cube = x^3]

main :: IO ()
main = print $ minimum [minimum ns | (_, ns) <- Map.toList cubes, length ns == 5]
```


```bash
$ ghc -O2 -o cubic-permutations cubic-permutations.hs
$ time ./cubic-permutations
real   0m0.044s
user   0m0.035s
sys    0m0.009s
```



## Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from collections import defaultdict
def cube(x): return x**3

def main():
    cubes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(10000):
        c = cube(i)
        digits = ''.join(sorted([d for d in str(c)]))
        cubes[digits].append(c)
    print(min([min(v) for k, v in list(cubes.items()) if len(v) == 5]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```


```bash
$ time python3 cube-permutations.py
real   0m0.060s
user   0m0.053s
sys    0m0.008s
```
