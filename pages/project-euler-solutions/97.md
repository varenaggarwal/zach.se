## Question

<p>
The first known prime found to exceed one million digits 
was discovered in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the 
form $2^{6972593}-1$; it contains exactly $2,098,960$ 
digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form 
$2^p-1$, have been found which contain more digits.
</p>

<p>
However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne 
prime which contains $2,357,207$ digits: $28433\times2^{7830457}+1$.
</p>

<p>
Find the last ten digits of this prime number.
</p>




## Commentary

The `gmpy` library makes this problem trivial. Using `gmpy`, this code
takes about half a second to run. Without `gmpy`, well, let's just say
it takes considerably more than a minute to run.

If you're dealing with large numbers in Python, I highly recommend `gmpy`.




## Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from gmpy2 import mpz
print(str(mpz(28433*2**7830457+1))[-10:])
```


```bash
$ time python3 non-mersenne.py
real   0m0.341s
user   0m0.336s
sys    0m0.004s
```
