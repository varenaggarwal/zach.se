## Question

Consider the fraction, $\frac{n}{d}$, where $n$ and $d$ are positive
integers. If $n \lt d$ and $\mathrm{HCF}(n,d)=1$, it is called a reduced
proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for $d \leq 8$ in
ascending order of size, we get:

$$\frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{7}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{2}{7}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{3}{8}, \frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{4}{7}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{5}{8}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{5}{7}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \frac{5}{6}, \frac{6}{7}, \frac{7}{8}$$

It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between $\frac{1}{3}$ and
$\frac{1}{2}$.

How many fractions lie between $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$ in the
sorted set of reduced proper fractions for $d \leq 12,000$?

    sieve (p:ps) xs = h ++ sieve ps [x | x <- t, rem x p /= 0]

                          | otherwise = primeFactors m ps
                          where (q, r) = quotRem m p

r :: Int -> Int
r limit = sum [(mobius m) * f (limit `quot` m) | m <- [1..limit]]

main :: IO ()
main = print $ r 12000
```


```bash
$ ghc -O2 -o fraction-range fraction-range.hs
$ time ./fraction-range
real   0m0.007s
user   0m0.000s

```



## Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from fractions import gcd

print(sum(1 for d in range(2, 12001) for n in range(1, d) if (n*3 > d) and (n*2 < d) and gcd(n, d) == 1))

```


```bash
$ time python3 fraction-range.py
real   0m35.286s
user   0m35.284s
sys    0m0.000s
```
