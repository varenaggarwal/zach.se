## Question

<p>
The rules for writing Roman numerals allow for many ways of writing each number 
(see <a href="http://projecteuler.net/about=roman_numerals">About Roman Numerals...</a>). However, there 
is always a "best" way of writing a particular number.
</p>

<p>
For example, the following represent all of the legitimate ways of writing the number sixteen:
</p>

<pre>
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
VIIIIIIIIIII
VVIIIIII
XIIIIII
VVVI
XVI
</pre>

<p>
The last example being considered the most efficient, as it uses the least number 
of numerals.
</p>

<p>
The 11K text file, <a href="http://projecteuler.net/project/roman.txt">roman.txt</a> (right click and 
'Save Link/Target As...'), contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not 
necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; that is, they are arranged in descending units 
and obey the subtractive pair rule (see <a href="http://projecteuler.net/about=roman_numerals">About Roman Numerals...</a> 
for the definitive rules for this problem).
</p>

<p>
Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their minimal form.
</p>

<p>
Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no more than 
four consecutive identical units.
</p>






## Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os

def subtractive(roman):
    result = roman
    replacements = [
        ("VIIII", "IX"), 
        ("IIII", "IV"), 
        ("LXXXX", "XC"), 
        ("XXXX", "XL"),
        ("DCCCC", "CM"), 
        ("CCCC", "CD"),
    ]
    for old, new in replacements:
        result = result.replace(old, new)
    return result

current = 0
improved = 0
for line in open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'roman.txt')):
    roman = line.strip()
    current += len(roman)
    improved += len(subtractive(roman))
print(current - improved)
```


```bash
$ time python3 minimal.py
real   0m0.019s
user   0m0.009s
sys    0m0.010s
```
