## Question

It turns out that 12 cm is the smallest length of wire that can be bent
to form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one way, but
there are many more examples.

**12 cm**: (3,4,5)

**24 cm**: (6,8,10)

**30 cm**: (5,12,13)

**36 cm**: (9,12,15)

**40 cm**: (8,15,17)

**48 cm**: (12,16,20)

In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to form an
integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than
one solution to be found; for example, using 120 cm it is possible to
form exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles.

**120 cm**: (30,40,50), (20,48,52), (24,45,51)

Given that $L$ is the length of the wire, for how many values of
$L \leq 1500000$ can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be
formed?







## Haskell

```haskell
import Data.Array

triples :: Int -> [Int]
triples limit = [a + b + c | u <- [1..l'], v <- [u+1,u+3..l'-u], gcd u v == 1,
                             let a = v^2 - u^2, let b = 2*u*v, let c = u^2 + v^2]
    where l' = round $ sqrt $ fromIntegral limit

perimeters :: Int -> Array Int Int
perimeters limit = accumArray (+) 0 (1, limit) $ map (\p -> (p, 1)) $ concat [takeWhile (<= limit) $ map (*p) [1..] | p <- triples limit]

main :: IO ()
main = print $ length $ filter (== 1) $ elems $ perimeters 1500000
```


```bash
$ ghc -O2 -o singular-triangles singular-triangles.hs
$ time ./singular-triangles
