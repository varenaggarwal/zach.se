## Question

You are given the following information,
but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

    1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
    Thirty days has September,
    April, June and November.
    All the rest have thirty-one,
    Saving February alone,
    Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
    And on leap years, twenty-nine.
    A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, 
    but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during 
the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?




## Commentary

The lesson of this exercise: know your modules!

```


```bash
$ time python3 first-sunday.py

```



## Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from calendar import monthrange; from itertools import product
print(len([(year, month) for year, month in product(list(range(1901, 2001)), list(range(1, 13))) if monthrange(year, month)[0] == 6]))

```bash
$ time python3 calendar-module-first-sunday.py
real   0m0.030s
user   0m0.022s
sys    0m0.008s
```



## Ruby

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'date'
puts Date.new(1901,1,1).upto(Date.new(2000,12,31)).find_all { |d| d.mday == 1 && d.wday == 0 }.count
```


```bash
$ time ruby first-sunday.rb
