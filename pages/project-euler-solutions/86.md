## Question

<p>A spider, S, sits in one corner of a cuboid room, measuring 6 by 5 by 3, and a fly, F, sits in the opposite corner. By travelling on the surfaces of the room the shortest &quot;straight line&quot; distance from S to F is 10 and the path is shown on the diagram.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>
<p>However, there are up to three &quot;shortest&quot; path candidates for any given cuboid and the shortest route doesn't always have integer length.</p>
<p>It can be shown that there are exactly 2060 distinct cuboids, ignoring rotations, with integer dimensions, up to a maximum size of M by M by M, for which the shortest route has integer length when M = 100. This is the least value of M for which the number of solutions first exceeds two thousand; the number of solutions when M = 99 is 1975.</p>
<p>Find the least value of M such that the number of solutions first exceeds one million.</p>






## Haskell

```haskell
isSquare :: Int -> Bool
isSquare x = let x' = truncate $ sqrt (fromIntegral x :: Double) in x'*x' == x

solutions :: Int -> Int
solutions m = length [1 | a <- [1..m], b <- [a..m], isSquare((a + b)^2 + m^2)]

main :: IO ()
main = print $ length $ takeWhile (<= 1000000) $ scanl1 (+) $ map solutions [0..]
```


```bash
$ ghc -O2 -o cuboid cuboid.hs
$ time ./cuboid
real   0m6.488s
user   0m6.484s
sys    0m0.000s
```
